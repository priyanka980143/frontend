        <li><b>2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>TAGS</b></li>
        <p>-The &lt;html&gt; tag represents the root of an HTML document. The &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for
            all
            other
            HTML elements</p>
        <li><b>Attributes</b></li>
        <p>-Attributes provide additional information about elements and always specified in the start tag.An HTML
            attribute is a piece of markup language used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML
            element.
            For example, attributes can be used to change the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements.
            Attributes
            are used by including them in an opening HTML tag:</p>

        </li>
        <p>-A void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text
            nodes).
            Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements. In HTML, a void
            element must not have an end tag.<br>
            <u> For example,</u> &lt;input type="text">&lt;/input&gt;,is invalid HTML.and other example for

        <p>-Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
            Some characters are reserved in HTML.
            If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with
                tags.
                Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
                <u>for example,</u>
                < less than &lt;> greater than &gt;
                    & ampersand &amp;

            The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:</P>
        Ex.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Coffee</li>
            <li>Tea</li>

            A description list is a list of terms, with a description of each term.
            The &lt;dl&gt; tag defines the description list, the &lt;dt&gt; tag defines the term (name), and the
            &lt;dd&gt; tag describes each term:</p>
        Ex.<br>
        <dl>

            <b> 8.How is cell pedding different from Cell spacing? With Example.</b>

            - Cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell's border and the content present
            in
            it.
            - Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells. One can create it
            using
            the tag of HTML &lt;table&gt;, but it sets the type attribute to cellpadding.

                example.</b>
        </li>
        <p>-We use the colspan and rowspan attribute, to merge cells in HTML. The rowspan attribute is for the
            number of
            rows a cell should merge, whereas the colspan attribute is for the number of columns a cell should
            merge.
            The attribute should be placed inside the <td> tag.</p>
        <p>-You can merge two or more table cells in a columm <b>using the colspan in a td HTML tag(table data).</b>

            to merge two or more row cells, use the rowspan attribute.</p>
