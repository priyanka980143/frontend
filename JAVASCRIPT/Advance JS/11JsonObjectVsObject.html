        <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="json-and-javascript">JSON and JavaScript</h2>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-json">What is JSON?</h3>
        <p>JSON is short for JavaScript Object Notation. So is JSON JavaScript? Not exactly. <strong>JSON is a data
                format that is independent of any </strong><a
                href="https://www.koombea.com/blog/best-back-end-languages-how-to-choose-the-perfect-one/"
                target="_blank"><strong>programming language</strong></a><strong>, although it is derived from
            </strong><strong>JavaScript</strong>. The bulk of modern programming languages contain code that can
            generate and parse JSON data.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A few notes on JSON:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data</li>
            <li>The syntax is self-describing, making it easy for humans to read and understand</li>
            <li>Typically, JSON is used when data is sent from a server to a web page&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JSON data is structured in two basic ways: a key/value pair or a collection of such pairs, or an ordered
            list. JSON allows six different types of data to be stored or transported, including:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Array</li>
            <li>Null</li>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>String&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Number&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As you can see, JavaScript and JSON are two completely different things. While JSON is derived from
            JavaScript, the two are not exactly comparable in any way. However, we can compare JSON to JavaScript
            objects. These two are more closely related, and they offer us a better comparison.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-javascript-objects">What are JavaScript Objects?</h3>
        <p>JavaScript objects are also used to store data. <strong>All </strong><strong>JavaScript</strong><strong>
                values are actually objects with the exception of primitive data types</strong>, null, Boolean, number,
            string, symbol, and undefined. JavaScript objects can get complex because they can contain a number of
            different primitive data combinations.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JavaScript objects are also structured in key/value pairs. They can be created by object constructor syntax,
            object literals, constructors, and prototypes. JavaScript objects are mutable. This means that you can
            change the value for a respective key in a key/value pair.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="json-vs-javascript-objects-what-are-the-differences">JSON Vs. JavaScript
            Objects: What are the Differences?</h2>
        <p>Before we look at the ways in which JSON and JavaScript objects differ, it is important to understand that
            JSON and JavaScript objects are far more similar than they are different. JSON is derived from JavaScript
            object literal syntax. In fact, the simplest explanation would be that <strong>JSON is
            </strong><strong>JavaScript object</strong><strong> literal syntax but with more
                restrictions</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JSON and JavaScript objects are both human-readable. They both give users a way to structure data, and they
            can both be used as the source for another source. When it comes to differences, JSON and JavaScript objects
            differ in a few key ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Language dependency&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Text only&nbsp;</li>
            <li>String vs. object</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="language-dependency">Language Dependency</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest differences between JSON and JavaScript objects is the dependency on a programming
            language. JavaScript objects are completely dependent on JavaScript. They wouldn’t work with any other
            programming language.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <strong>JSON is supported by more than 50 different </strong><strong>programming
                languages</strong>, including popular languages such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Perl</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This wide array of support makes JSON a flexible choice for data storage and transfer.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="text-only">Text Only</h3>
        <p><strong>JSON data</strong><strong> can only be presented in text</strong>. You cannot add comments or other
            lines of code to JSON. This rigidity is the reason why so many other programming languages can generate and
            parse JSON.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>JavaScript objects can include other code such as functions and methods. This allows for a greater degree of
            complexity and function.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="string-vs-object">String Vs. Object</h3>
        <p>The last major difference between JSON and JavaScript objects is the way they are presented. JSON is
            presented in a string. These are referred to as JSON strings. JavaScript objects can contain strings, but
            they are, as their name suggests, objects instead of strings. Objects are more complex than strings.</p>
        <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>The differences between JSON and JavaScript objects are slight and nuanced. Likely, your organization won’t
            have to worry about making a choice between these two unless you are a tech company working in web
            development.</p>
