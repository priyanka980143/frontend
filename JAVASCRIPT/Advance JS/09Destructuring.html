    <title>Destructuring</title>

    <pre>
        The two most used data structures in JavaScript are Object and Array.

        Objects allow us to create a single entity that stores data items by key.
        Arrays allow us to gather data items into an ordered list.
        Although, when we pass those to a function, it may need not be an object/array as a whole. It may need individual pieces.

        Destructuring assignment is a special syntax that allows us to “unpack” arrays or objects into a bunch of variables, as sometimes that’s more convenient.

        Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on. Soon we’ll see that.

    <script>
        let arr = ["John", "Smith"]

        // destructuring assignment
        // sets firstName = arr[0]
        // and surname = arr[1]
        let [firstName, surname] = arr;

        console.log(firstName); // John
        console.log(surname);  // Smith


        let options = {
            title: "Menu",
            width: 100,
            height: 200
        };

        let { title, width, height } = options;

    </script>
