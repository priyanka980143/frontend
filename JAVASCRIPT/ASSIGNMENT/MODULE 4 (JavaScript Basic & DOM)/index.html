            <h2>Q-1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                -It's a versatile programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic
                content on websites. Originally created to make web pages more interactive, it's now a key
                component in web development<br>
                JavaScript allows you to add features like user authentication, form validation, and dynamic
                content updates without requiring the user to refresh the page. It's commonly used in
                conjunction with HTML and CSS to create modern, interactive web applications.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A simple, interpreted programming language is JavaScript.</li>
                <li>designed for the development of network-centric applications.</li>
                <li>linked with and complementary to Java.</li>
                <li>connected with and complementary to HTML.</li>
                <li>Open and platform-neutral</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Q-2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
            <p>
                -The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or
                not. It returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the
                Number.isNaN() Method.
            </p>
            <h4>Parameter Values: This method accepts a single parameter as mentioned above and described
                below:</h4>

            <p><strong>value:</strong> It is a required value passed in the isNaN() function.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Return Value:</strong> It returns a Boolean value i.e. returns true if the value is NaN else
                returns false.</p>
            <hr>


            <h2>Q-3. What is negative Infinity?</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>negative infinity </strong>in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to
                represent a value that is
                the lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be
                generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> JavaScript shows the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Negative infinity </strong>is different from mathematical infinity in the following
                ways:-
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by any other number.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN
                </li>
                <li>
                    Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is
                    negative
                    infinity</li>
                <li>
                    NaN is NaN when multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY
                </li>
                <li>
                    Negative infinity, divided by any negative number (apart from negative infinity) is positive
                    infinity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.

                </li>
                <li>
                    The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.</li>
                <li>
                    The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.
                </li>

            <h2>Q-4. Which company developed JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                -JavaScript was developed by Netscape Communications Corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
                -It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape. Initially named
                "Mocha," it was later renamed to "LiveScript," and finally, due to a partnership with Sun
                Microsystems, it was named JavaScript to leverage the popularity of Java at that time. Despite
                the name, JavaScript and Java are distinct and unrelated programming languages.
            </p>

            <h2>Q-5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
            <p>
                When a variable is declared but not given a value, it is said to be undefined. A keyword is not
                undefined.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we attempt to access a variable that has not yet been initialized or declared using the var
                or
                const keyword, we get the undeclared error. We will get a runtime error with the return value of
                "undefined" if we attempt to retrieve the value of an undeclared variable using the 'typeof'
                operator. The undeclared variables always have a global scope.
            </p>

            <div class="undefind">
                For example: Undefined: <br>
                undefined <br>
                console.log(geek) <br>
                let geek; <br>

                    <p><strong>Undeclared:</strong></p>

            <p>Javascript is a very important language when it comes to learning how the browser works. Often
                there are times we would like to add dynamic elements/content to our web pages. This post deals

            <!--------- Question-7---------->
            <div>
            <h2>Q-7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h2>

            <h3>1.ViewState:-</h3>
            <p><strong>Scope:</strong>ViewState is used to store state information that is specific to a single
                web page.</p>
            <p><strong>Storage:</strong> The information stored in ViewState is maintained on the client side,
                usually in a
                hidden field. It's included in the page's HTML and sent back and forth between the client and
                the server with each request/response.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Lifetime:</strong> ViewState is short-lived and is only available during the lifespan of
                a single page.
                Once the user navigates away from the page, the ViewState is lost.</p>
            <p><strong>Usage:</strong> ViewState is often used to persist state information between postbacks
                (round-trips
                between the client and server) for a specific page. It helps in maintaining the state of
                controls
                on the page across postbacks.</p>

            <h3>2.SessionState:-</h3>
            <p><strong>Scope:</strong> SessionState is used to store state information that needs to be shared
                across multiple
                pages during a user's session.</p>
            <p><strong>Storage: </strong>The information stored in SessionState is maintained on the server. It
                can be stored
                in-memory, in a separate process, or in a database, depending on the configuration.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Lifetime:</strong> SessionState persists throughout the user's session, which starts when
                the user
                accesses the website and ends when they close the browser or their session times out.</p>
            <p><strong>Usage:</strong> SessionState is commonly used to store user-specific information, such as
                user
                preferences, authentication details, or shopping cart contents, across multiple pages.</p>

                <h2>Q-8 .What is === operator?</h2>
                <p>
                    The === operator is a strict equality operator in JavaScript. It is used to compare two values
                    for
                    equality without performing type coercion. This means that not only the values being compared
                    must be equal, but they must also be of the same data type.
                </p>
                <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                <p>If the operands are of the same type and have the same value, `=== `returns `true`.</p>
                <p>If the operands are of different types or have different values, `===` returns `false`.</p>

                <h4>Example:-</h4>
                <p>5 === 5 // &nbsp; &nbsp; true, because both operands are of the same type and have the same
                    value.</p>
                <p>5 === '5' //&nbsp; &nbsp; false, because the operands are of different types (number and string)
                </p>
                <p><strong>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</strong></p>

            <h2>Q - 9 How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h2>
            <p>
                This article will teach us how to modify an element's style or class. The UI is crucial if you
                want
                to create a cool website or app. With the use of JavaScript, any CSS property from an HTML
                element
                can be modified, added, or removed in response to any event. We are able to complete this work
                using
                one of two popular methods.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>style.property</li>
                <li>Changing the class itself</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> CSS can be modified using the style property to:

            <h2>Q - 10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                On the client side, you can’t read or write files in JavaScript browsers. The fs module in Node.js
                may be used to accomplish this on the server-side. It has methods for reading and writing files
                on the file system that are both synchronous and asynchronous. Let’s demonstrate some
                examples of reading and writing files with the node.js fs module.
            </p>
            <p>The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript.
                The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method. This technique reads
                the full file into memory and stores it in a buffer.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>Syntax:</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function )</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Parameters:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>filename: </strong>It includes the filename to read or, if the file was saved
                    somewhere
                    else, the entire path.
                </li>
                <li>The encoding of the file is kept there. The default value is 'utf8'.
                </li>
                <li>This is a <strong>callback </strong>function that is used after the file has been read.
                    There
                    are two inputs needed.
                </li>
                <li><strong>err:</strong> if there was a mistake
                </li>
                <li> <strong>data: </strong>The contents of the file.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Return Value: </strong>It provides both the file's contents and any faults that
                    might
                    have happened.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Data is written asynchronously to files using the fs.writeFile() function. The file will be
                replaced
                if it already exists.

                <h2>Q-11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>
                    In the last chapter, we discovered how to use conditional statements in JavaScript by using
                    practical programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learn about looping and jump control statements in this chapter. Code blocks can be run in
                    loops
                    as many times as necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, the following looping statements are supported:
                </p>
                <p>In Loop</p>
                <p>During Loop</p>
                <p>Loop while doing</p>

                <h3>For Loop Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    When a loop is used, it performs the three specified tasks (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement
                    3) a
                    fixed number of times. The general syntax of the "for" statement is demonstrated in the
                    following
                    code.
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
                    <div>
                        for (initialization; condition; increment/ decrement){<br>
                        Executed these statements;<br>
                        }
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>While Loop Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Of all looping statements, the while one is the most straightforward. While a particular
                    condition
                    is true, a block of code is repeated in a while loop. The three distinct jobs have been carried
                    out
                    in the for loop. The same three specific activities are carried out in the while loop as well as
                    where it is mentioned in the statement, but the initialization and conditions of the while loop
                    take
                    place in various locations. The code below demonstrates the while statement's basic syntax:
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Syntax:</h3>

                        Execute these statements; //true <br>
                        Increment/decrement; <br>
                        }
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>do-while Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    The while statement and the do-while statement are related. The condition is present outside the
                    statement in the do-while construct. If the condition is not met, it will still run at least
                    once.
                    If the condition is true, the code will continue to run; if the condition is false, the code
                    will
                    cease running. The general syntax of the while statement is shown in the following code:
                </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Q-12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript uses the parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) functions to convert a string
                    to an
                    integer. When the string doesn't contain a number, the parseInt() function returns NaN (not a
                    number). Only the specified number will be returned if a string containing a number is given.
                    Spaces
                    are not permitted in this function. If a specific number is supplied with spaces, the portion of
                    the
                    number that appears before the space is returned as the output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can use the parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) to turn a string into an integer. An
                    illustration is used to discuss each of them.
                </p>


                <h3>Using the parseInt() method</h3>
                <p>The parseInt() method's syntax is</p>
                <p>parseInt(string); parseInt(string,radix);</p>

                <h3>Where,</h3>
                <p>
                    The string to be parsed is called string.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Number System, the radix is used to refer to the basis. 8 is octal, 10 is decimal, 16 is
                    hexadecimal, and 2 is binary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The integer value that was extracted from the string is returned by this procedure.
                </p>

                <h3>Using the Number() method</h3>
                <p>The Number() method's syntax is</p>
                <p>Number(value)</p>
                <p>
                    If value is not of a primitive data type that can be converted to a number, NaN is returned. A
                    number is returned by this procedure.
                </p>

                <h3>Using the unary operator</h3>
                <p>The unary plus operator's syntax is.</p>
                <p>+op;</p>
                <p>
                    where an operand is op. The unary operator + tries to turn the operand into a number when it is
                    put
                    before it. The response is a number.

            <h2>Q-15. What is the use of Void (0)?</h2>
            <p>
                The use of `void(0)` in JavaScript is often seen in the context of using it as the href
                attribute in
                an anchor (`<a>`) tag to create a "void" or "no-operation" link. This is typically done to
                    prevent
                    the page from navigating to a new URL when the link is clicked.

            </p>

            <P><STRong>Example:</STRong></P>
            <div>
                &lt;h1 style="color:green"&gt;GeeksforGeeks&lt;/h1&gt;<br><br>

            <!------- Question-16------->
            <h2>Q-16.How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
            </h2>

            <p>- One way to make a page load another page in JavaScript is by using the
                <strong>`window.location`</strong>
                object. You can set the<strong>` href `</strong>property of this object to the URL of the
                page you want to load.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
            <div>
                &lt;script&gt;<br>
                window.location = &lt;Path / URL&gt;<br>
                &lt;/script&gt;
            </div>


           <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
            <div>
                &lt;script&gt;<br>
                window.location = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/"<br>
                &lt;/script&gt;
            </div>

            <p>
                In the example above, we can see that modifying the window.location object inside of
                Javascript
                allows us to forcefully load any page from Javascript without using a href tag. We'll create
                a
                simple working example so we can learn it on the job.
            </p>
            <h3>Here is how it is done step by step:</h3>
            <p>
                Step 1. Make a file called index.html as the first step. Add two buttons and a heading to
                it.
                One
                button forces the loading of a live URL while the other forces the loading of a local HTML
                page.
                Two
                functions are contained in the script> tag; one loads the gfg homepage, and the other uses
                the
                window.location property to load a local HTML page.
            </p>
            <div class="example-2">
                &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
                &lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>

                &lt;body&gt;<br>
                &lt;h3&gt;This is the original page&lt;/h3&gt;<br>

                <br>
                &lt;script&gt;<br>
                function force_load_wekipedia() {<br>
                window.location ="https://www.wikipedia.org/"<br>

            <!------ Question-17 ------>
            <h2>Q - 17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
            </h2>
            <p>
                <strong> - innerHTML</strong> is a convenient and commonly used property in JavaScript for
                manipulating the
                content of HTML elements, it comes with some disadvantages:

            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1.Security Risks:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Using <strong>innerHTML`</strong> to manipulate content with user input can expose your
                application to
                cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. If you're injecting user-generated content into
                the HTML
                using <strong>`innerHTML`</strong>, you need to ensure that the content is properly
                sanitized to prevent malicious
                scripts from being executed.</p>

            <p><strong>2.Performance Concerns:</strong></p>
            <p>• Manipulating the innerHTML of an element involves re-parsing and
                re-rendering the entire content of that element. If you're frequently
                updating large portions of the DOM, it can lead to performance issues. In
                such cases, using other methods like DOM manipulation directly might be
                more efficient.
            </p>


            <p><strong>3.Event Handlers and References:</strong></p>
            <p>• If your HTML contains elements with attached event handlers or references
                to JavaScript objects, using<strong> innerHTML</strong> to replace or modify the content
                might inadvertently remove these bindings. You would need to reattach
                event handlers or re-establish references after using innerHTML.
            </p>

            <p><strong>4.Overwrites Existing Content:</strong></p>
            <p>• When you use <strong>innerHTML </strong>to set content, it overwrites the existing content
                of the element. If there are other elements or data within the container
                that you want to preserve, you'll need to manually handle merging or
                appending new content</p>

            <p><strong>5.Limited to HTML Markup:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>• innerHTML</strong> is designed for HTML content. If you are working with XML or
                need to manipulate non-HTML content, other methods like textContent
                or createDocumentFragment might be more appropriate.</p>
            <p><strong>6.Browser Inconsistencies:</strong></p>
            <p>• While <strong>innerHTML</strong> is widely supported, there can be slight variations in
                behavior across different browsers. It's essential to test and ensure
                consistent behavior, especially when working with more complex HTML
                structures.
            </p>
            <p>In summary, while <strong>innerHTML</strong> is a powerful tool for HTML manipulation, it
                should be
                used carefully, especially when dealing with user input or dynamic content. Consider the
                context and potential security implications, and explore alternative approaches like
                DOM manipulation methods when necessary.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                This post will demonstrate how to use JavaScript to hide and reveal passwords. When filling
                out
                a
                form, there may be instances where we need to type a password and want to review our
                previous
                input.
                There is a checkbox that, when selected, makes the characters visible so that you can see
                that.
                In
                this lesson, we'll use JavaScript to implement the toggle password feature.
