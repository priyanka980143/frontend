    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>Scripting Language for making our web page dynamic</p>

        some CSS on it</p>

        <li>HTML is the structure of your page like the headers, the body text, any images you want to include. It
            basically defines the contents of a web page.</li>
        <li>CSS controls how that page looks (it’s what you’ll use to customize fonts, background colors, etc.).</li>
        <li>JavaScript is the third element. Once you’ve created your structure (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS),
            JavaScript makes your site dynamic (automatically updateable).</li>
    </ul>
