             <h2>Q-1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
             <p>
                 A dynamic computer programming language is called JavaScript. Its implementations enable client-side script to interact with users and create dynamic pages, and it is most frequently used as a component of web pages. It is an object-oriented programming language that may be interpreted. LiveScript was the original name of JavaScript, but Netscape changed it to JavaScript, maybe in response to the buzz that Java was causing. LiveScript, the predecessor to JavaScript, had its debut in Netscape 2.0 in 1995. Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers all contain the general-purpose language's core.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A simple, interpreted programming language is JavaScript.</li>
                    <li>designed for the development of network-centric applications.</li>
                    <li>linked with and complementary to Java.</li>
                    <li>connected with and complementary to HTML.</li>
                    <li>Open and platform-neutral</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Client-Side JavaScript</h3>
                <p>
                    Client-side The most popular variation of the language is JavaScript. For the script's code to be recognized by a browser, it must be incorporated into or referenced from an HTML document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It implies that a web page need not be static HTML, but rather may contain programs that communicate with users, manage browsers, and generate HTML content on the go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over typical CGI server-side scripts, the JavaScript client-side method offers a number of benefits. JavaScript, for instance, can be used to determine whether a user has supplied a valid email address in a form field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a user submits a form, JavaScript is run, and only if all of the entries are correct are they sent to the web server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User-initiated events, including as button clicks, link navigation, and other explicit or implicit user activities, can be caught using JavaScript.
                </p>

                <h3>Advantages of JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>The merits of using JavaScript are -</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Less server interaction</strong> and the ability to validate user input before to transmitting the page to the server are two benefits of using JavaScript. Because of the reduced server traffic, your server will be under less stress.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The visitors receive immediate </strong>feedback and don't have to wait for the page to reload to find out whether they forgot to type something.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Enhanced interactivity - </strong> You may design interfaces that respond when the user moves their mouse cursor over them or presses a keyboard shortcut to activate them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Richer interfaces</strong>You can use JavaScript to integrate sliders and drag-and-drop elements to provide your site visitors with a Rich Interface.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Limitations of JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript can't be used as a legitimate programming language. It lacks the following crucial components:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-side It is not possible to read or write files using JavaScript. This is still here for security purposes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Because there is no such support, JavaScript cannot be utilized for networking applications.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            JavaScript lacks the ability to use multiple processors or threads

            <h2>Q-2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h2>
            <p>
                The isNaN() function in JavaScript can be used to determine whether a given value is or is not an unlawful number. If the value is a NaN, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false. The Number is not the same as it.isNaN() Function.
            </p>

            <h2>Q-3. What is negative Infinity?</h2>
            <p>
                In Java script, a negative infinity is a number that is created by "dividing a negative number by zero.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not necessary to create a number object in order to access this static attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                The negative value of the infinity property of the global object is the same as the value of negative infinity.
            </p>
            <h3>In contrast to the mathematical infinity, the values react differently:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Any positive value multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY, including POSITIVE_INFINITY.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a negative value is multiplied by another negative value, the result is POSITIVE_INFINITY. This includes NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Zero is NaN when multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NaN is NaN when multiplied by NEGATIVE_INFINITY
                </li>
                <li>
                    NEGATIVE_INFINITY is POSITIVE_INFINITY when divided by any other negative number besides NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NEGATIVE_INFINITY is NEGATIVE_INFINITY when divided by any positive value other than POSITIVE_INFINITY.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Negative_infinity is NaN when divided by either negative or positive infinite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Zero is the result of any division by NEGATIVE_INFINITY.

            <h2>Q-4. Which company developed JavaScript?
            </h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> developed JavaScript while working at <strong>Netscape Communications</strong> in 1995. JavaScript was created by Netscape and Eich as a scripting language for use with Netscape Navigator, the company's primary web browser. In order to portray JavaScript as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner Sun Microsystems, Netscape changed the language's name from LiveScript to JavaScript. Despite some superficial grammatical similarities, JavaScript and the Java programming language are unrelated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following its release, more and more browsers began to support JavaScript. JavaScript was nevertheless not regarded as a serious programming language for a significant portion of its history. Early versions had significant speed and security problems, but there were no other options available to developers. They had to utilize JavaScript if they wanted to run programs in the browser.

            <h2>Q-5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h2>
            <p>
                When a variable is declared but not given a value, it is said to be undefined. A keyword is not undefined.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we attempt to access a variable that has not yet been initialized or declared using the var or const keyword, we get the undeclared error. We will get a runtime error with the return value of "undefined" if we attempt to retrieve the value of an undeclared variable using the 'typeof' operator. The undeclared variables always have a global scope.

Using <strong>setAttribute</strong>, the class attribute is changed after the textContent has been adjusted. A data attribute or any other kind of attribute, similar to how you can do so in HTML, might also be added using this. Using the appendChild method of the body element, the element is then finally attached to the body.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's actually essentially the same as &lt;h1 class="note" &gt; New Heading!!! &lt; /h1 &gt;.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ability to create and style pieces "on the fly" is the strength of what we see today. You may either add every element to the page as you develop it or you can use the <strong>createElement()</strong>method to create and insert HTML elements dynamically at runtime.

                The JavaScript Strict Equality Operator compares two operands and returns true if the operands' values and types match. Since there is no type conversion, the operation will return false even if the value stored in the operands is the same but their types are different.

                This article will teach us how to modify an element's style or class. The UI is crucial if you want to create a cool website or app. With the use of JavaScript, any CSS property from an HTML element can be modified, added, or removed in response to any event. We are able to complete this work using one of two popular methods.

            <ul>

            <h2>Q - 10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h2>
                <p>
                    File reading and writing are not supported on the client side by JavaScript browsers. The Node.js fs module can be used for this on the server-side. It has techniques for reading and writing files on the file system that are both synchronous and asynchronous. Several examples of the node.js fs module reading and writing files will be displayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To read and write files, utilize Javascript's fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() APIs. The file is read via an internal technique called fs.readFile(). This approach reads the entire file into memory and stores it in a buffer.

            <h2>Q-11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                In the last chapter, we discovered how to use conditional statements in JavaScript by using practical programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We learn about looping and jump control statements in this chapter. Code blocks can be run in loops as many times as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, the following looping statements are supported:
            </p>
            <p>In Loop</p>
            <p>During Loop</p>
            <p>Loop while doing</p>

            <h3>For Loop Statement</h3>
            <p>
                When a loop is used, it performs the three specified tasks (Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3) a fixed number of times. The general syntax of the "for" statement is demonstrated in the following code.
            </p>

            <div class="q-11-syntax">

                    }

            </div>

            <h3>While Loop Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Of all looping statements, the while one is the most straightforward. While a particular condition is true, a block of code is repeated in a while loop. The three distinct jobs have been carried out in the for loop. The same three specific activities are carried out in the while loop as well as where it is mentioned in the statement, but the initialization and conditions of the while loop take place in various locations.

            <h2>Q-12. • How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript uses the parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) functions to convert a string to an integer. When the string doesn't contain a number, the parseInt() function returns NaN (not a number). Only the specified number will be returned if a string containing a number is given. Spaces are not permitted in this function. If a specific number is supplied with spaces, the portion of the number that appears before the space is returned as the output.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can use the parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) to turn a string into an integer. An illustration is used to discuss each of them.
            </p>

            
            <h3>Using the parseInt() method</h3>
            <p>The parseInt() method's syntax is</p>
            <p>parseInt(string); parseInt(string,radix);</p>
                
            <h3>Where,</h3>
            <p>
                The string to be parsed is called string.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Number System, the radix is used to refer to the basis. 8 is octal, 10 is decimal, 16 is hexadecimal, and 2 is binary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The integer value that was extracted from the string is returned by this procedure.
            </p>

            <h3>Using the Number() method</h3>
            <p>The Number() method's syntax is</p>
            <p>Number(value)</p>
            <p>
                If value is not of a primitive data type that can be converted to a number, NaN is returned. A number is returned by this procedure.
            </p>

            <h3>Using the unary operator</h3>
            <p>The unary plus operator's syntax is.</p>
            <p>+op;</p>
            <p>
                where an operand is op. The unary operator + tries to turn the operand into a number when it is put before it. The response is a number.

            <p>
                <q>javascript:void(0)</q> may have occasionally appeared in an HTML document. It is frequently used when adding an expression to a web page can have unintended consequences. The command <q>javascript:void(0)</q> is used to reverse this effect. This expression yields a primitive value that is undefinable. This is frequently applied to hyperlinks. You may occasionally choose to execute some JavaScript from a link. Depending on the URL provided, the browser typically loads a fresh copy of the current page when you click a link. But if you've connected some JavaScript thereto link, you probably don't want this to happen. Using void(0) would stop the page from refreshing.

            <h2>Q-16. • How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?
            </h2>
                <p>
                    In this post, we'll look at how JavaScript can be used to compel one page to load another.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Approach: To forcefully load another page in Javascript, we can use the window.location attribute inside the script element. It is a pointer to a Location object, which stands in for the document's current location. By visiting a window, we can modify its URL.
                </p>
                <div class="q-16-syntax">
                    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
                    <div class="q-16-syntax-output">
                        &lt;script&gt;<br>
                            window.location = &lt;Path / URL&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/script&gt;
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="q-16-example">
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <div class="q-16-example-output">
                        &lt;script&gt;<br>
                            window.location = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/"<br>
                        &lt;/script&gt; 
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    In the example above, we can see that modifying the window.location object inside of Javascript allows us to forcefully load any page from Javascript without using a href tag. We'll create a simple working example so we can learn it on the job. 
                </p>
                <h3>Here is how it is done step by step:</h3>
                <p>
                    Step 1. Make a file called index.html as the first step. Add two buttons and a heading to it. One button forces the loading of a live URL while the other forces the loading of a local HTML page. Two functions are contained in the script> tag; one loads the gfg homepage, and the other uses the window.location property to load a local HTML page.

            <h2>Q - 17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Step The Document Object Model (DOM)'s innerHTML attribute is used to set or return an element's HTML content. where the textual content of the HTML element is represented by the return value. It enables JavaScript code to alter a website that is currently being shown. More specifically, it alters or restores an element's internal HTML information. Since it is the simplest approach to manipulate DOM, the innerHTML property is frequently used to alter the contents of webpages. But utilizing innerHTML in JavaScript has several drawbacks.
            </p>

            <h3>Using JavaScript's innerHTML property has the following drawbacks:
            </h3>

            <p>
                The process of employing innerHTML is more slower since its contents are constructed gradually and because previously parsed elements and contents must be re-parsed, which takes time.

                keeps any DOM element's event handlers in tact: The new elements produced by automatically setting innerHTML do not acquire event handlers. To do this, one must manually attach the event handlers to new elements and maintain track of the event handlers. On some browsers, this can result in a memory leak.
            </p>
            <p>
                All content has been changed: When you use innerHTML to add, append, delete, or edit material on a webpage, all of the content and any DOM nodes inside that element are replaced and recreated.
            </p>
            <p>
                InnerHTML appending is not supported: In JavaScript, adding is often done with the += operator. However, when using innerHTML to append to an HTML tag, the entire tag is re-parsed.

            <div class="q-17-example">
                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <div class="q-17-example-output">
                    &lt;p id="geek"&gt;Geeks&lt;/p&gt; <br>
                    title = document.getElementById('#geek') <br>
                    
                    // The whole "geek" tag is reparsed <br>
                    title.innerHTML += '&lt;p&gt; forGeeks &lt;/p&gt;'

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                Problem: The old content gets overwritten even while the item is present.object innerHTML is used.Instead of using object.innerHTML += 'html', use innerHTML + 'html'. Appending is impossible without repartitioning the entire innerHTML. As a result, using innerHTML becomes extremely sluggish. When dynamic DOM elements must be formed, string concatenation simply cannot scale since it becomes challenging to keep track of the plus signs and quotation marks' openings and closings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Can cause the document to be broken: Since innerHTML does not offer appropriate validation, any legitimate HTML code can be used. The JavaScript document might be broken as a result. Even flawed HTML can be utilized, which could result in unpleasant surprises.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ability of innerHTML to add text and components to the webpage makes it possible for malevolent users to change and display unwanted or destructive content within other HTML element tags. This is known as cross-site scripting (XSS). Additionally, critical information may be lost, leaked, or changed as a result of cross-site scripting.

            <h2>Q - 18. Create password field with show hide functionalities
            </h2>
            <p>
                This post will demonstrate how to use JavaScript to hide and reveal passwords. When filling out a form, there may be instances where we need to type a password and want to review our previous input. There is a checkbox that, when selected, makes the characters visible so that you can see that. In this lesson, we'll use JavaScript to implement the toggle password feature.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Approach:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create an HTML form with a password-only input field. </li>
                <li>Make a checkbox that will serve as the toggle. </li>
                <li>Make a function that responds to the checkbox being clicked by the user.</li>
            </ul>

                    <p>Password is Welcome12@. </p>
                    <p>So, on typing it will show like this ********* </p>
                    <p>And on clicking the checkbox it will show the characters: Welcome12@.</p>
