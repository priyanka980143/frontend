    <h2>State</h2>
    <p>The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component’s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system-generated events and these changes determine the behavior of the component and how it will render.  
</p>
<li>A state can be modified based on user action or network changes</li>
<li>The state object is initialized in the constructor</li>
<li>The state object can store multiple properties</li>
<li>this.setState() is used to change the value of the state object</li>
<li>setState() function performs a shallow merge between the new and the previous state</li>
<li>State is used to store the data of the components that have to be rendered to the view</li>
<li>State holds the data and can change over time</li>
<li>State can only be used in class components</li>
<li>Event handlers generally update state</li>

<h2>Props</h2>
<p>In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes. </p>
