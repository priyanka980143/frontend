            <h4>ReactJS Functional Components</h4>
            <p>Functional Component is one way to create components in a React Application. React.js Functional Components helps to create UI components in a Functional and more concise way. In this article, we will learn about functional components in React, different ways to call the functional component, and also learn how to create the functional components. We will also demonstrate the use of hooks in functional components</p> 
            <h4>Advantage of using hooks in functional components</h4>
            <p>The problem discussed above is solved with the help of a special ReactJS concept called “hooks”. ReactJS has access to a special hook called useState(). The useState() is used to initialize only one state variable to multiple state variables. The first value returned is the initial value of the state variable, while the second value returned is a reference to the function that updates it.</p>
